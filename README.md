# FarmerCrossing
 A very basic Puzzle Game where the player must Help A farmer with his wolf, duck and bag of corn who come to the east side of a river and they wish to cross. There is a boat at the riverâ€™s edge, but of course only the farmer can row. The boat can only hold two things(including the rower) at any one time. If the wolf is ever left alone with the duck, the wolf will eat it. Similarly, if the duck is ever left alone with the corn, the duck will eat it.  How can the farmer get across the river so that all four arrive safely on the other side?
